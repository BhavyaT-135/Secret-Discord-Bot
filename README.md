# Secret-Discord-Bot
We've created a Discord multi-purpose bot
named “SECRET” using python as our central programming language.

The inclusion of various python libraries provides us the framework to
work upon. We could thus program several functions and tasks that our
bot could perform for the servers that adopt it.

“SECRET” can perform a wide range of tasks that include some
responsive test functions, an 8ball trivia game, performing admin rights
functions, a fully functioning music player that uses YouTube as its
search platform, a token-rank feature based on user activity, an 
interactive AI chatbot feature, Wikipedia search and some developer
functions for better performance.
